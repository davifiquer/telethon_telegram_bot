# telethon_telegram_bot

Telegram bot to send message to one/various contacts

First Steps:

Before working with Telegram’s API, you need to get your own API ID and hash:

Login to your Telegram account(https://my.telegram.org/) with the phone number of the developer account to use.

Click under API Development tools.

A Create new application window will appear. Fill in your application details. There is no need to enter any URL, and only the first two fields (App title and Short name) can currently be changed later.

Click on Create application at the end. Remember that your API hash is secret and Telegram won’t let you revoke it. Don’t post it anywhere!

After the above steps, run the <b>authenticator.py</b> script to create the user authorization file.

With your auth_user.txt you can use the app.

Synchronous version.

Version 1.0

It's a simple personal job, new features coming soon...
